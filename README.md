- **Lifting State Up**: Share state between components by lifting it up to the nearest common ancestor.
- **Derived States**: Derive state values from props or other state variables.
- **useReducer Hook**: Manages complex state logic with a reducer function.
- **Children Props**: Pass components as props to other components.
- **useContext Hook**: Access context values without prop drilling.
- **Custom Hook**: Reusable function that encapsulates logic using hooks.
- **CSS Modules**: Use CSS Module to have the modular styles.
- **Tests**: Use Vitest and React-Testing-Library for developing project tests.
